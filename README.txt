Movie Trailer Website
=====================

This project you are about to view is my take on Udacity's movie trailer website. Although very simple in terms of layout it gives you a straight forward way to see the trailers for six of my favorite films.

WHAT'S INCLUDED

*Also included in the .zip are three folders containing css, images, and fonts used on the site.

PREREQUISITES
=============

Python 2.7 and an up-to-date browser is required to run the files.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
=======================

Using Atom, you will:

1.	Open entertainment_center.py

The application will open in your default browser.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

This project was built to fulfill only the basic requirements for the course. Future development will begin at a later time.
