Movie Trailer Website
=====================

This project you are about to view is my take on [Udacity's](http://www.udacity.com/) movie trailer website. Although very simple in terms of layout it gives you a straight forward way to see the trailers for six of my favorite films.

===============

-	entertainment_center.py
-	fresh_tomatoes.py
-	media.py

*Also included in the .zip are three folders containing css, images, and [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/) fonts used on the site.*

PREREQUISITES
=============

[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an up-to-date browser is required to run the files.
